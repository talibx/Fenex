🧾 Project Brief: Local Inventory Management System Enhancement (Laravel Website)
1. System Overview

This is a Laravel-based local inventory and product management website that I use to track my stock and shipments to Amazon.ae.

The website keeps records of products and inventories.

When I ship products to Amazon, I update the quantity here to know how many pieces remain locally.

When I receive new stock from China or local suppliers, I first add it here before sending part of it to Amazon.

This system helps me manage local stock levels and track what has been shipped or kept for local sales.

💡 Note:
The website is not directly connected to Amazon — I only input the data manually here.
All real sales and deductions happen on the Amazon.ae hub, and I just record the related data in my local system for tracking and reports.

2. Current Main Pages

Products Page

Shows all products I own.

Displays product details (SKU, name, cost, etc.).

Inventory Page

Shows how many pieces I have in stock.

Allows adding or subtracting quantities (e.g., new stock arrivals, shipments to Amazon).

When I add inventory, it shows a list of products so I can update their quantities.
